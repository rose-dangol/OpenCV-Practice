manual implementation of the LBPH algorithm not calling OpenCV's high-level functions [cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()]

compute_lbp() function for pixel comparisons
lbph_features() to split the image and compute histograms
saved custom (label, feature_vector) pairs to a .npy file
compared new face vectors using Euclidean distance manually
